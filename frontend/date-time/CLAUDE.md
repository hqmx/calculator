## Development Notes

### Date Handling Best Practices
```javascript
// Always use UTC for consistency
const date = new Date(Date.UTC(2025, 0, 15)); // Jan 15, 2025

// Handle timezone offsets properly
const localDate = new Date(dateString);
const utcDate = new Date(localDate.toISOString());

// Validate dates
function isValidDate(date) {
    return date instanceof Date && !isNaN(date.getTime());
}
```

### Common Date Calculations
```javascript
// Add days to date
function addDays(date, days) {
    const result = new Date(date);
    result.setDate(result.getDate() + days);
    return result;
}

// Difference in days
function daysDifference(date1, date2) {
    const oneDay = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
    return Math.round((date2 - date1) / oneDay);
}

// Is business day (Mon-Fri)
function isBusinessDay(date) {
    const day = date.getDay();
    return day !== 0 && day !== 6; // Not Sunday or Saturday
}
```

### Testing Scenarios
1. Leap years (Feb 29)
2. Month-end dates (Jan 31 + 1 month)
3. Year boundaries (Dec 31 → Jan 1)
4. DST transitions
5. Very old dates (< 1900)
6. Far future dates (> 2100)
7. Different time zones
8. Midnight edge cases (00:00:00)
