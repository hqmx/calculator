### What is BMI Section

**Title**: What is Body Mass Index (BMI)?

**Content**:
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight. The formula is:

**BMI = weight (kg) / [height (m)]²**

BMI is used as a screening tool to identify potential weight problems in adults. It's a quick and easy method, but it doesn't directly measure body fat.

**Important Notes**:
- BMI is not a diagnostic tool
- It may not be accurate for athletes with high muscle mass
- Different standards may apply for children and teens
- Consult healthcare providers for comprehensive health assessment

### FAQ Section

**Title**: Frequently Asked Questions About BMI

**Q1: Is BMI an accurate measure of health?**
A: BMI is a useful screening tool, but it's not perfect. It doesn't account for muscle mass, bone density, overall body composition, or racial and sex differences. Always consult healthcare professionals for comprehensive health assessment.

**Q2: How often should I calculate my BMI?**
A: It's recommended to check your BMI every 3-6 months if you're monitoring weight changes, or annually as part of regular health checkups.

**Q3: Does BMI apply to everyone?**
A: BMI calculations may not be accurate for:
- Pregnant women
- Competitive athletes and bodybuilders
- People over 65 years old
- Children and teenagers (require age and sex-specific BMI charts)

**Q4: What should I do if my BMI is outside the normal range?**
A: If your BMI indicates you're underweight or overweight:
1. Consult a healthcare provider or dietitian
2. Consider lifestyle changes (diet and exercise)
3. Get a comprehensive health assessment
4. Don't rely solely on BMI for health decisions

**Q5: Can I use BMI to track fitness progress?**
A: BMI can be one metric, but it's better combined with other measurements like:
- Body fat percentage
- Waist circumference
- Muscle mass measurements
- Overall fitness levels

**Q6: Why does my BMI differ from online calculators?**
A: If using the same units (metric or imperial), all calculators should give the same result. Differences may occur if:
- Units are mixed (kg with feet/inches)
- Rounding differences
- Measurement errors
